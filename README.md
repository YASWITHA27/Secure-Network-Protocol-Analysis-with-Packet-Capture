# Secure-Network-Protocol-Analysis-with-Packet-Capture
Performed an in-depth network security analysis using Wireshark to compare the Telnet and SSH protocols. Evaluated Telnet’s vulnerabilities, including the transmission of unencrypted credentials, against SSH’s robust encryption mechanisms. Analyzed packet data to identify patterns of potential exploitation, extracted critical information such as IP and MAC addresses, and demonstrated how secure protocols like SSH mitigate risks. The analysis provided actionable insights into the importance of encrypted communications in protecting sensitive network data.
